If you need to join two tables and apply a WHERE clause to the joined table, it is generally more efficient to perform
the filtering directly in the database query rather than retrieving all the columns
and applying the equality comparison in a DataFrame.

Here's why:

Selecting all columns: If you select all the columns from both tables and then perform the equality
comparison in a DataFrame, it requires transferring all the data from the database to the application.
This can be inefficient, especially if the tables have many columns or if there is a large amount of data to be transferred.

DataFrame operations: Performing operations in a DataFrame, such as filtering and equality comparisons, 
involve additional processing overhead in the application layer.
DataFrame operations are generally slower compared to equivalent operations performed directly in the database.


In summary, it is recommended to perform the filtering and join operation in the database query itself
to take advantage of database optimizations and minimize data transfer. 
Only retrieve the necessary columns from the tables and let the database handle the filtering. 
This approach typically results in better performance compared to retrieving all the columns and applying the equality comparison in a DataFrame.
