Subject: Request for API Health Status

Dear [Team],

I am writing this email to request information regarding the health status of the APIs that are being used in our Dataminer tool. As you know, the tool is heavily dependent on these APIs, and any downtime can severely impact the functionality of the tool. Therefore, I would like to request that you provide me with information regarding the health status of the APIs.

It would be of great help if you could provide us with a dashboard or some sort of status page that can provide real-time updates on the health status of the APIs. This would allow us to take proactive measures to reduce the consumption of these APIs during their downtime.

In addition, I would like to suggest that we implement a failover mechanism to handle situations where an API goes down unexpectedly. This will ensure that the tool continues to function without any interruptions, even if one or more APIs are down.

I appreciate your help in this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you,

[Your Name]
